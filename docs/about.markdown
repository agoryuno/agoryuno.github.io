 This is a collection of posts with notes from my exploration
  of various topics in causal inference, data science, and all
  kinds and purposes of coding.

  These notes are mostly meant for my own future self and, 
  as such, might be in a state of (hopefully temporary) disarray.
  I do try to tidy them up and bring them to a logical conclusion
  in hope that other people might benefit from them.
