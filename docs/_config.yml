# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Data and coding notes

  This is a collection of post with notes from my exploration
  of various topics in causal inference, data science, and all
  kinds and purposes of coding.

  These notes are mostly meant for my own future self and, 
  as such, might be in a state of (hopefully temporary) disarray.
  I do try to tidy them up and bring them to a logical conclusion
  in hope that other people might benefit from them.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
